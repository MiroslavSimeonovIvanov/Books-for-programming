Miscellaneous
=============

This repository contains solutions to various of problems that I adapted to C# from the books of Herbert Schildt - Java, Teach Yourself C++ and C, the complete reference.
As well as I translated the tasks, which I solved from the book of Robert Sedgewick - Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4 Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching (3rd Edition) to JavaScript.
